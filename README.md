# The Messiah
In The Messiah, you play as an Overseer, a member of an elite society tasked with preventing an all-out war between the great houses. According to prophecy, a single heir—the true messiah—will unite the world. However, only those of royal blood can claim this destiny. As the Overseer, your mission is to abduct an heir from one of the great houses and subject them to a trial, testing whether they are truly the prophesied savior or an imposter. The house and heir you choose will determine their starting stats and abilities, shaping their strengths and weaknesses. Once you have chosen your heir, the perspective shifts—you now play as the heir, facing the brutal trials designed to prove or break you. Will you fulfill the prophecy, or will the great houses be doomed to war?
